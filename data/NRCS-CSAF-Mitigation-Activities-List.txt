Notes
In addition to the designated CSAF conservation activities listed, conservation practices that facilitate the management
or the function of a CSAF activity but may not achieve the desired effects on their own (and may not have a quantifiable
benefit), may be planned as applicable in consultation with your local professional conservation planner. Examples: TreeShrub Establishment (612) may need facilitating practices such as Tree/Shrub Site Preparation (490) or Access Control (472).
Conservation Crop Rotation (328) may need facilitating practices such as Pest Management Conservation System (595),
Cover Crops (340), or Irrigation Water Management (449). Waste Separation Facility (632) may need facilitating practices
such as Waste Transfer (634) or Roofs and Covers (367). Prescribed Grazing (528) may need facilitating practices such as
Watering Facility (614), Stream Crossing (578), Brush Management (314), Fence (382), or Livestock Shelter Structure (576).
[1] Provisional activities and their associated enhancements are added under the premise that they may provide benefits,
and a quantification methodology will be evaluated during the fiscal year. Practices may be removed from the mitigation
practice list in a subsequent fiscal year if quantification is not possible. Unless otherwise noted, listed practices have
quantifiable carbon sequestration and/or GHG reduction methodologies described in COMET-Planner (comet-planner.com).
New practices will be added as science progresses and scientifically defensible quantification methodologies are identified
to accompany existing and new NRCS conservation practice standards.
[2] The included Conservation Practice Standard and Conservation Stewardship Program links provide national
information. Please consult the NRCS office at your local USDA Service Center for any local and state level criteria.
Visit farmers.gov/service-locator to find contact information for your local office.
[3] The following were removed from the list for FY2024: Conservation Practice Standard Upland Wildlife Habitat and
Management (Code 645) and Enhancements (E645B) Manage existing shrub thickets to provide adequate shelter for wildlife,
(E645C) Edge feathering for wildlife cover, (E328G) Crop rotation on recently converted CRP grass/legume cover for soil
organic matter improvement, (E528D) Grazing management for improving quantity and quality of food or cover and shelter
for wildlife, and (E528E) Improved grazing management for enhanced plant structure and composition for wildlife. Two
enhancements were archived and are no longer available within CSP: (E512E) Forage and biomass planting that produces
feedstock for biofuels or energy production and (E512K) Establishing native species into forage base to improve diversity
for both livestock and wildlife. Bundles for CSP are no longer listed in this document, refer to program guidance for CSP
information on the use of appropriate bundles.
[4] The practice is considered a mitigation activity only when implemented in the specified way. A brief description of the
specific implementation is identified and associated narratives for conservation planning purposes are included at the end of
the document. When a specific implementation is not specified, any narrative of the practice may be used for planning under
the assumption that it will provide mitigation benefits.
[5] Mitigation categories are for organizational purposes only and do not indicate land use restrictions for the practice.
